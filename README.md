This is a piece of software that I've been meaning to write for a while now. And indeed, this is the 4th or 5th attempt
to do so. In essence, it's going to be a training log for me and ... maybe others, too.

**Diving dolphin** is a working title. [This is a diving dolphin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ-aVoY9hlE).

The second purpose of this repository is to give me a playground for all things Rails:

- [At work](https://ioki.com/api/), we use RSpec, but I want to play with Minitest.
- I've used Bootstrap a lot, but Tailwind sounds so nice!
- [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org/) are really, really cool.
- I don't need NewRelic, but I want to know what it can do for me.
- I've never set up a GitHub Actions workflow before.
- And though a 100% test coverage is not a sign of good software quality, I want to see how long I can keep it up there.
